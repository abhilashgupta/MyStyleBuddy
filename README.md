# MyStyleBuddy
A web application to recommend you fashion choices (clothes and accessories), based on your physical attributes (skin color, body shape, height, age), clothing color preferences and the occasion/event (festival/formal/casual etc).

This was submitted as a hack at the Yahoo! HackU hackathon at IIT Bombay in 2013 and was one of the two submissions to win a special mention at the event.

This submission was originally available at http://hackyourworld.org/~iitb_2013_foobar/mystylebuddy/index.php and other submissions were also available at the same site but the site seems to no longer be maintained.
